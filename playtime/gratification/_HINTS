Exercise: 
  Write a page for the say application that
  illustrates the looping you can do in ERb.

What I did:

  - wrote a simple template called erb_loops.rhtml in the app/views/say
    directory

  Experiment with adding and removing the minus sign at the
  end of the ERb <%= %> sequence (ie, changing %> into -%> 
  and vice versa. Use your browsers View->Source
  option to see the difference.
  
What I did:
  - add and remove the minus signs in the erb_loops.rhtml template
    and look at the page source
